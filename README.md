This is the repository of our paper "**A TWO-STAGE PROGRESSIVE NEURAL NETWORK FOR ACOUSTIC ECHO CANCELLATION**" accepted by INTERSPEECH 2023.

In this paper, we propose a two-stage progressive neural network for acoustic echo cancellation with a modeling capacity from low-quality to high-quality, which is shown as follows:
